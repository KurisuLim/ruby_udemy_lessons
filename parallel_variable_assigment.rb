# Parallel Variable Assignment

a = 10
b = 20
c = 30

p a
p b
p c

# Call variables in 1 line
p a, b, c

# No like breaker
# puts

# print a, b, c

# a will be assign 10, b will be assign 20 and c will be assign 30
a, b, c = 10, 20 ,30

# swap value

a = 1
b = 2

p a, b

a = 2
b = 1
p a, b

#Short hand
a, b = b, a
